**Caio Petelinkar's portfolio website**  
Showcasing product case studies, features, and side projects.

## 🧭 About

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website — [petelinkar.com](https://petelinkar.com) — where I share stories behind the products I've worked on, features I've developed, and strategic use cases from my experience as a Product Manager.

The goal is to document not just the *what*, but the *why* and *how* behind product decisions — including:
- 🔍 Problem framing
- 🧪 User research & discovery
- 🎯 Feature prioritisation
- 🛠️ Product delivery
- 📈 Outcomes & learnings

## 🛠️ Built With

- WordPress + custom theme (PortfolioGrove)
- Gutenberg Block Editor
- SCSS / Custom CSS
- Git for version control

## 🚧 Status

Ongoing – I'm continuously improving the site and adding new case studies and content.
