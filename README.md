**Caio Petelinkar's portfolio website**  
Showcasing product case studies, features, and side projects — while also serving as a sandbox for ongoing technical development.

## 🧭 About

This is the source code for my personal portfolio — [petelinkar.com](https://petelinkar.com) — where I share the stories behind products I’ve worked on, features I’ve built, and strategic use cases from my experience as a Product professional.

It’s also where I explore and sharpen my technical skills — including version control, theme development, deployment workflows, and performance optimisation.

The aim is to document not just the *what*, but the *why* and *how* behind product decisions — including:

- 🔍 Problem framing  
- 🧪 User research & discovery  
- 🎯 Feature prioritisation  
- 🛠️ Product delivery  
- 📈 Outcomes & learnings

## 📁 Repo Scope

This repo contains only the contents of the `wp-content/` directory:

- `themes/` — Custom portfolio theme (`PortfolioGrove`)
- `plugins/` — Optional plugins (if any)
- `mu-plugins/` — (Optional) Must-use plugins
- `.gitignore` — Excludes uploads, logs, env files, etc.

WordPress core files are not tracked here — they are managed via the hosting or local environment (e.g. LocalWP).

## 🧠 How I Use This Repo

This repository powers my personal portfolio and blog. I maintain it as a technical sandbox — version-controlling theme code, experimenting with new features, and using tools like Git and DeployHQ to manage deployments.

Rather than tracking WordPress core files, I focus on what I’m building and learning inside the `wp-content/` structure. This keeps the setup lean and lets me iterate on my site like I would on any digital product.
